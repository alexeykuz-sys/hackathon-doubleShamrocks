## Deployment
### Local Deployment

The site was developed in GitPod and pushed to the following remote GitHub repository - here
The following GIT commands were used throughout deployment:
git status ------ used to check the status of files and any changes made / untracked.
git add -A ------ to stage files ready to commit.
git commit -m " " ------ to commit the files.
git push ------ to push the files to the master branch of the GitHub repo.

### Heroku Deployment
This site is hosted using Heroku, deployed directly from the master branch via GitHub. - LIVE SITE

The following steps were taken to complete the hosting process.
Set debug=False in the app.py file.
Created a requirements.txt file from the terminal, using pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt, to allow Heroku to detect this project as a python app and any required package dependencies.
Created a Procfile using echo web: python app.py > Procfile from the Gitpod terminal so Heroku would be informed on which file runs the app and how to run this project.
Created a new Heroku app, my-recipe-m3 and set its region to Europe.
Automatic deployment was set up on Heroku - On the app dashboard, in the deploy menu. Connect to GitHub section. The GitHub repository was searched for and connected to the app.
In the settings tab on the app dashboard, 'Reveal Config Vars' was used to tell Heroku which variableS are required to run the app. The following config vars were added:
IP
PORT
SECRET_KEY
MONGO_URI
In GitPod, a check was completed to ensure the master branch was up to date and all commits had been pushed to GitHub, ready for Heroku to deploy.
Clicked the Enable Automatic Deploys button located in the Deploy section of Heroku to allow for automatic deploys.
Clicked the Deploy Branch button located in the Deploy section of Heroku to finally deploy this project.
Clicked the View button to launch this project's app.
The deployed site on Heroku will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch in the GitHub Repo : REPO
